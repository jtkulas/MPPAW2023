## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(palmerpenguins)
library(tidyverse)
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r viz}
df1<-penguins%>%filter(year==params$year)
df1 %>%
ggplot() +
 aes(x = island) +
 geom_bar(fill = "#0c4c8a") +
 theme_minimal()
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
